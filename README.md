# Gymini - Your personal AI coach

Gymini is a private, data-driven fitness and nutrition ecosystem. It combines a streamlined logging interface with local AI intelligence to help you track your progress, analyze your habits, and reach your goals without sacrificing your data privacy.

## 🚀 How to Use Gymini

### 1. Log Your Training

Gymini supports a dual-track system to ensure every type of movement is captured accurately.

- **Strength Training:** Tap **Add Exercise** and stay on the "Strength" tab. Enter the exercise name, weight, sets, and reps.
- **Cardio Sessions:** Tap the **Cardio** toggle. The interface will switch to distance-based tracking. Enter your **Distance (km)** and **Duration (minutes)**.
- **Workouts:** Once your exercises are added, enter your total workout duration and save. Gymini stores these in a local database for long-term tracking.

### 2. Track Your Nutrition

The meal logger goes beyond calories by tracking your relationship with food.

- **Log Meals:** Describe what you ate in the text field.
- **Hunger Levels:** Use the "Hunger Before" and "Hunger After" scales. This allows the system to analyze which food types provide the best satiety for you.
- **Chronological Feed:** View your history to see meal timing and frequency throughout the day.

### 3. Consult Your AI Coach

The built-in AI assistant acts as a personal data scientist who has studied your entire history.

- **Informed Advice:** The coach automatically reviews your last **100 meal entries** and **50 workout logs** before answering.
- **Ask Anything:** You can ask:
  - _"How has my strength improved over the last 10 sessions?"_
  - _"Is my cardio performance better on high-carb or high-protein days?"_
  - _"Am I resting enough between my heavy lifting days?"_
- **Privacy-First:** Your data is processed into a summarized text format for the AI, ensuring your logs are used only to provide you with better coaching.

### 4. Settings & Personalization

Tailor the intelligence of Gymini to your specific body metrics and preferred coaching style.

- **API Configuration:** To enable the AI Coach, enter your API key (OpenAI, Gemini, or DeepSeek) in the Settings menu. Your key is stored securely on your device and never shared.
- **User Profile:** Set your physical profile, including age, weight, and fitness goals. This provides the baseline data the AI needs to calculate things like volume intensity and calorie burn estimates.
- **Custom AI Instructions:** This is the "Brain" of your coach. You can enter specific rules for how the AI should talk to you.
  - _Example:_ "Always be blunt and focus on scientific efficiency," or "Act as a supportive coach who prioritizes recovery over intensity," or "I'm trying to lose weight."
  - These instructions persist across all chats, so you don't have to repeat your preferences.
